Based on [lwsm](https://github.com/johannesjo/linux-window-session-manager).

## setup
1. Make sure you have nodejs installed (e.g. execute `node -v` and if there is no output [install it](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)). 
2. Install [lwsm](https://github.com/johannesjo/linux-window-session-manager) via npm: `npm install -g linux-window-session-manager` (on some systems you might want to use `sudo`)
3. Download or clone repository and move all files to `/home/your-user-name/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/lwsm@johannes.super-productivity.com`:
4. In some cases - especially when you're using nvm, you might need to configure the path to your lwsm installation (which you can find out via `which lwsm` after a successful installation) extension via `gnome-shell-extension-prefs`. 

```
cd tmp
git clone git@github.com:johannesjo/gnome-shell-extension-window-session-manager.git
mv gnome-shell-extension-window-session-manager /home/$(whoami)/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/lwsm@johannes.super-productivity.com
```

# usage
After a successfull setup you should see an "screen" icon at your top bar. Click on it to open the menu. To save your first window session click on the text input and enter a name for it. Click on the save icon to save it. 

After this can either restore a previously saved session by clicking on the play icon, delete them by clicking on the x icon or update them by clicking on the save icon. 

The opened applications and windows are saved independently for each screen combination, which means that you can have a different set of applications and arrangements for each of them and also need to save them indepdently.
